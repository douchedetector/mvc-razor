Hi. I'm a Clone of the Codeplex Project
======================================
I put this project here for a number of reasons. First, I think Github is far superior at fostering collaboration between developers - and I think the ASP.NET Web Stack bits can benefit from that.

So - let the forks happen! Then we push them back up stream to codeplex... easy peasy!

Some Rules
----------
If you do fork, the ASP team has kindly ask that you consider their Roadmap and also be sure your code compiles etc. I'll take that (kindly) a step further: if you fork and do a pull request, I would ask that you provide failing tests to highlight the issue.

Be Kind To The Diffs
--------------------
Nothing is worse then reading a massive RED diff file. Please be kind and don't reformat the code - just leave it the way the team has written it. 

Testing
-------
If you submit a pull request, please use the testing project they have so the tests can easily be diffed and merged right in. Let's make this as simply as possible.


ASP.NET is a free web framework for building great web sites and applications.
============================================================================

This site is the home of the ASP.NET MVC, Web API, and Web Pages source code. If you want to use the released versions of these products to develop your applications, visit http://www.asp.net to find official installers, documentation, tutorials, samples, and videos.

These products are actively developed and supported by the Microsoft ASP.NET team in collaboration with a community of open source developers. Together we are dedicated to creating the best possible platform for web development.

Contribute
==========
There are lots of ways to [contribute](http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Contributing&referringTitle=Home) to the project.

You can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the ASP.NET Team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

Roadmap
=======
ASP.NET MVC 4, Web API and Web Pages 2 are currently in Beta. The source code on this site is under active development for the Release Candidates that will be our next deliverable. For details on our planned features and future direction please refer to our [roadmap](http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Roadmap).
